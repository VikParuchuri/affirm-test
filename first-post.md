# Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to [Affirm](http://www.affirm.io)!  This is a blogging platform where posts are written in Markdown.  I created Affirm after struggling to find a service that did everything I wanted it to do.

What did I want?

* Complete ownership of my content
* Version control
* The ability to not worry about configuration and just write
* The power to customize everything if needed

Posts are written in markdown, which is an awesome alternative to WYSIWYG editors.  Markdown is elegant and fast.  Look at the [documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for more info.
